/**
 * A {@link org.sodeac.common.snapdeque.SnapshotableDeque} provides an implementation of {@link java.util.Deque}. Iterating through deque requires creating a {@link Snapshot}. A snapshot is immutable regardless of possible changes in source deque.
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * <strong>Unlike {@link java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList} a {@link org.sodeac.common.snapdeque.SnapshotableDeque} never creates a deep copy of content, neither when modifying, nor when reading or creating a snapshot.</strong>
 * Iterating through a snapshot requires no locks inside of snapshot or source deque. The goal is to prevent a big performance slump for very large deques. This is realized by versionable linked lists with different branches inside of deque.
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * It is recommend to close snapshots after use to remove unneeded version-branches.
